# Task 2 - Air Pollution PM2.5 Prediction
### Description:
"Air Pollution PM2.5 Prediction" analyze and predicts fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels in the air. PM2.5 also called Particulate Matter (PM) ,describes fine inhalable particles, with diameters that are generally 2.5 micrometers and smaller,can enter the respiratory system and cause health problems. This study intends to gather insights into PM2.5 concentration patterns and trends, identify variables influencing its levels, and construct a forecast model for future PM2.5 levels.
